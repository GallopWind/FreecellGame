# FreeCell game

Freecell is a very classic solitaire game. Since 2000, some fans have began to find an efficient solver for it.

This is my built with pygame.

# AI

Can we build a AI to play it as smart as human? As for me, finding the solve can be done in less than 200 steps search. Human intelligence is awesome!

I have tried DRN method to solve this problem. But its performance was terrible. Some inherent problem can not be solved.

While looking deeply into this problem, after reading some reference, I got lessons from AlphaZero.

I have trained a MLP to emulate the steps number to the final for every game state. The data was generated by reverse searching scripts on servers.
Then replace the Rollout method with heuristic search, whick perfomance better in solve space of this problem.

And the solver now can find the solve in 2000 steps in some cases that are not hard(these cases require even 10000 steps to solve, the cost expands exponentially).

I will keep working on it during my free time : )
